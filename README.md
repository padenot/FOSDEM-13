# What is this?

It's the slide from my talk at FOSDEM 2013 in the Mozilla DevRoom.

# What is the video?

It's the first minute of the documentary "Indie Game, The Movie"
(<http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/>). I believe one minute is considered
fair-use. I can take it down anytime. If you haven't seen it and at least
remotely interested by indie game, go watch it.

It was used to demonstrate early prototype of h.264 decoding in Firefox. It
probably won't work on your version of Firefox at the time of this writing.

# Where are the images from?

The audio code comparison graph is from <http://www.opus-codec.org/comparison/>,
modified so that colour-blind people can understand what it is about.

All the other images have been made in Inkscape for this presentation.

# What is the slidedeck?

<http://github.com/codepo8/shower>, which is afaik a Mozilla template for
another slide deck system.

# Can I read this online ?

Yup, <http://padenot.github.com/FOSDEM-13>.

#What is the license

CC0 (for the images and text I made, that is, not for the audio codec comparison
chart nor the video).
